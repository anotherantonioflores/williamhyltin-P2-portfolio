### Pardon the Dust

This site is intended to serve as a repository for different analytic exercises and assignments done over the course of my education in the Data Analytics Masters Program at UTSA. In it you can expect to find:

-   Analyses
-   Visualizations
-   Applications of statistical methods
-   The slow spiral of a man drowning in the sea of his own imposter syndrome
-   Insights, hopefully

Please use the `Menu Bar` at the top to peruse to your liking.

**Analytics is a combination of both art and science. Incidentally, robots are already better than us at both, but here's to trying.**
